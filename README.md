# Local-LLM
A local neural network trained on science, politics, and religion. No clickbait. No influence. No injected bias. No cloud. No data harvesting. 60 terabytes of raw text 15 trillion tokens. It runs from USB. It can be trained on you - but it's owned by no one. When the network goes down, it keeps thinking. Ollama-powered. Always offline.
